- **I love making stuff with my own hands.**

  - Back in undergrad, I studied Mechanical Engineering and worked on lots of fun projects, like train coupler, and even made two science exhibits that ended up on display at the China Science and Technology Museum! I’ve got some photos of them [here](/files/Fun_projects.pdf). 

  - Besides, I recently love in origami. I’ve folded some Pokémon models following designs by [Henry Phạm](https://www.youtube.com/@henryphamorigami) and [Wan Origami](https://www.youtube.com/@wanorigami9291), and I’m also learning how to design my own!

- **I love sports**
  
  - Basketball
    
  - Cycling — my longest ride a single day so far is 150 kilometers, and I’m training to get stronger

Besides these, I’m a fan of Chinese calligraphy and was a member of my hometown’s Calligraphers Association. I also can play the violin. I love exploring new hobbies and making friends. If you ever feel like chatting, just drop me an email!
